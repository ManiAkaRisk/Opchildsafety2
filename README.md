==========================================================================================================================================

Greetings users around the globe we are GhostSec. I Userware would like to take an opportunity to announce the resuming of an operation called #OpChildSafety. As part of the Anonymous collective it is our responsiblity not just as activists or hacktivists but as a collective to fight against the mass pedophilia on the internet. We GhostSec ask every user who is watching this. those who are willing to join the hunt down of these sick freaks who deserve to be sentenced behind bars and worse.

Such lawlessness must not continue on yet these beasts come back again and again promising that they won’t do it ever again! Well guess what users? That’s what they all say over and over and over AGAIN! They just couldn’t keep their promises now do they?! I think we shouldn’t stay soft any longer to these sick freaks!


But GhostSec why? The governments are actually trying their best to punish these criminals. Oh really? Let me tell you the truth user. We vigilante hackers are trying our best not to get caught by the law enforcement. To be honest I really lost faith in them. Some countries like Sweden and Norway just let these rapists go unsc athed. In contrast, a hacker can go to 6 months to 6 years depending of what acts he committed or probably even a decade. However, these fiends just get away with it.

Now are you convinced user? Are you willing to let these sadistic fucks get away with it like nothing ever happened? I’m sure you do feel that fury of yours that has struck inside of you, you want to relief it somehow with that murderous intent of yours. However, I need you to calm down because it won’t work that way. These criminals would have wished they were never been born with their sick lustful desires. So all we can do is by giving them the agony to torment their minds. Knock down their doors! To avenge the victims especially the children in exchange for their sanity. That's why we won't let them get what they wish for.

How can we achieve our united goal through online hacktivism and even activism?

First for hacktivism, our goal would be to shutdown and expose as many of these child pornography or pedophilia sites and forums that exist, this can be done through everyone's favorite and most popular method DDoS attacks though we encourage  to leave that as a last option, we recommend first attacking the web servers through any other means, exfiltrate as much data as possible, gather info on users and admins of the site, deface the sites, etc etc and remember anything goes.

The main goal is to use any means to attack, and disrupt our targets child pornography and pedo operations

For activists how you may help?
You all can spread and support our cause through writing and getting people to acknowledge it, it will encourage others to join the operation or even let people who can't support our cause directly at least know we exist and are fighting for the children who have been victimized.

#OpChildSafety initiated.

We are Anonymous
We are Legion
We do not Forgive
We do not Forget the silence of the victims
Expect us
we run shit because we can!

PS:
